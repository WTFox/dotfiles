# This is not meant to override .tmux-sessionizer.  At first i thought this
# would be a good command, but i don't think its ackshually what i want.

# Instead, its a list of commands to run on windows who's index is way outside
# of the first 10 windows.  This allows you to create as many windows in your
# session as you would like without having your workflow interrupted by these
# programatic windows

# how to use:
# tmux-sessionizer -w 0 will execute the first command in window -t 69.
# TS_SESSION_COMMANDS=(<cmd1> <cmd2>)

# TS_LOG=true # will write logs to ~/.local/share/tmux-sessionizer/tmux-sessionizer.logs
# TS_LOG_FILE=<file> # will write logs to <file> Defaults to ~/.local/share/tmux-sessionizer/tmux-sessionizer.logs
