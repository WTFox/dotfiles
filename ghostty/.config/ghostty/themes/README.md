To use any of these themes:

1. Navigate to your Ghostty config directory (usually `$HOME/.config/ghostty`)
2. Inside the Ghostty config directory, create a directory named `themes` if it does not exist already.
3. Save the theme file(s) of your choice in this directory.
4. Edit the Ghostty config file (usually `$HOME/.config/ghostty/config`) and append one of the following lines based on your preference:

## Available Themes
